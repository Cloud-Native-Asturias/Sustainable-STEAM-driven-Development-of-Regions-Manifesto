#  Sustainable STEAM-driven Development of Regions

We are uncovering better ways of developing peoples of the world through STEM by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

<p style="text-align: center;">
Alliances and collaborations over knowledge silos<br>
Attracting sustainable STEM talent over wasting it outside the region<br>
Embrace innovation over conservative strategies<br>
Promote sustainable STEM development over speculative bubbles<br>
People and relationships over goals and objectives<br>
Think beyond the limits established over initiatives and conformist thoughts<br>
</p>

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

We, as implementers, follow these principles:

- The highest priority is to make the represented region visible on the international STEM landscapes.
# All initiatives are driven by transparency, honesty, and respect people.
# Promote the sustainable development, within the region we represent, through STEM.
# Define a clear range of alignment options which must be followed by the participants.
# The promoted initiatives are meant to have the highest impact possible.
# Exchange among people and cultures must be encouraged.
# Work with a committed set of people.
# Celebrate the wins, even the small ones, and hold on the bad moments.
# Hope for the best, be ready for the worst, and enjoy the change.
# Continuous improvement should be advocated at any time based on feedback.
# Always plan strategy thinking on the future of the region and its people, not only the present day.
