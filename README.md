#  Sustainable STEAM-driven Development of Regions

We are uncovering better ways of developing regions through STEM by doing it and helping others do it. We promote STEAM as key drivers of sustainable development and social well-being of a region.

Through this work we have come to value:

<p style="text-align: center;">
- Alliances and collaborations over knowledge silos<br>
- Attracting sustainable STEM talent over wasting it outside the region<br>
- Embrace innovation over conservative strategies<br>
- Promote sustainable STEM development over speculative bubbles<br>
- People and relationships over goals and objectives<br>
- Think beyond the limits established over initiatives and conformist thoughts<br>
</p>

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

We, as implementers, follow these principles:

1. Boost the region's visibility and competitiveness on international STEAM landscapes.
2. Promote socio-emotional skills and 4 c's of learning 21st century essential for the development of a region.
3. Foster interdisciplinarity, promoting interaction with areas such as the arts, business, philosophy or the humanities, and regions.
4. Promote a social and educational context in which children, girls in particular, are encouraged, capable and
recognized so that they can choose their future without conditioning.
5. Define a clear range of alignment options which must be followed by the participants.
6. Embrace the UN 2030 Agenda.
