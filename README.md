#  Sustainable STEAM-driven Development of Regions

We are uncovering better ways of developing regions through STEAM by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

<p style="text-align: center;">

- Alliances and collaborations over knowledge silos<br>
- Attracting sustainable STEAM talent over losing it outside the region<br>
- Embrace innovation over conservative strategies<br>
- Promote sustainable STEAM development over speculative bubbles<br>
- People and relationships over goals and objectives<br>
- Think beyond the limits established over initiatives and conformist thoughts<br>
</p>

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

We, as implementers, follow these principles:


1. Boost the region's visibility and competitiveness on international STEAM landscapes.
2. Promote socio-emotional skills and Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity of learning 21st century essential for the development of a region.
3. Foster interdisciplinarity within the regions by promoting interaction with areas such as the arts, business, philosophy, or the humanities.
4. Promote a social and educational context in which children, teenagers, and senior people, are encouraged, capable, and recognized so that they can onboard on the STEAM world without conditioning.
5. Reduce the gap in technology, for girls and women from the regions, through a strategy based on STEAM.
5. Define a clear range of alignment options which must be followed by the participants.
6. Embrace the UN 2030 Agenda.
